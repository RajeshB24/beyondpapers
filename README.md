## Beyond Papers 
Trying to do small gradient update to AI/ML Research with keen interest to build community of  "Code before Research paper, random and open Experiments before perfect solution". Building value beyond papers.
 
Each algorithm will have easy to understand underlying intution and architecture breif mentioned by concept contributors and collaborators. Before moving experimental to launched atleast 3 usage examples, associated medium post and concept video will be linked in the document for quick reference. 

### Launched:
...Just getting started...
       


### Live Experiments:

#### Switchers:
Concept Contributors : Rajesh Balakirshnan (rajeshbalakrishnan24@gmail.com)
Concept Collaborators : <Looking for Collaborations> | If you have developed any algorithm scratch you probably have good intution. 
Code Collaborators : <Looking for Collaborations> | You speak Python
Adoption Collaborators: <Looking for Collaborations> | You have written medium post on a Machine learning Algorithm / posted atleast one video on AI
